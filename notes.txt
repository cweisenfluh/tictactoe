Ran the following ng commands to create the game.

npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new ttt
ng serve --open
ng generate component game
ng add @angular/material
npm install --save bootstrap
ng generate class game-play 
ng generate class game-status

business logic is in the game-play module.  game status is an enum for tracking start and
